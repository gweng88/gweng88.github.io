**My past week**

I showed up for walk-in at HackTX and couldn't get in, so I spent the weekend relaxing. I also crammed hard for a vector calculus test and have already forgotten everything. After taking differential equations and linear algebra, you would expect to start to see the relationship between the different areas, but I'm still puzzled by much of the "larger picture".

**What's in my way?**

I want to value *really* understanding math over temporary cramming for a grade. 

**Next week?**

Next week I have to somehow survive and algorithms test on Monday and going to the UH hackathon CodeRed over the weekend. Against my better judgement, I'm committed to going to CodeRed and having a good time with some friends from UH.

**What's my experience of the class?**

My quiz grades are killing my overall grade. I've had to miss class for interviews and missing lecture doesn't make it easy to catch up. 

**Pick-of-the-week**
