**My past week**

Last week I failed an algorithms test and destroyed my sleep schedule causing me to miss SWE quizzes.

However, I accepted a summer internship offer from HomeAway! 

**What's in my way?**

I'm grateful my group has the database portion figured out. Now it's just up to me to get good at front-end.

**Next week?**

I'll be working on finishing some more portions of the website for SWE.

**What's my experience of the class?**

I've gotten a 0 on 3 quizzes in a row. Hopefully the streak ends soon.

**Pick-of-the-week**
