**My past week**

This past week, nothing much happened. I did the usual: going to class, doing assignments, and wasting time on reddit. In contrast to the week of career fair, things have calmed down. 

**Next week?**

This week I am going to plow through my assignments and prepare for upcoming tests. After I get done with this week's work, I'm going to start early on next week's work (haha). Like always, I'm hoping to work on some personal projects in my extra time but that usually doesn't pan out.

**What's in my way?**

Even though it's pretty early into the semester, I feel like I'm already running out of steam. I don't have as much work this week as last week, but I'm taking longer to do it than before. 
	
**What's my experience of the class?**

We've started work on Project #2. I'm experienced in neither front-end nor back-end. For now I'm working on the static pages for Project 2, and will probably end up some amount of front end for the rest of the project. As for lectures, aside from the GCP talk, we're still covering python details, which is mostly review for me.

**Pick-of-the-week**

Recent lectures reminded me of this funny talk on behavior that doesn't make sense in programming languages. If you're scrolling through student blogs on piazza, **CHECK THIS OUT**. It's pretty good.
