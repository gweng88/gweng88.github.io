**My past week**

This past week I finished up my first algorithms test. I didn't do as well I wanted so I'll be sure to take the class more seriously from now on. I spent a nice chunk of time setting up a raspberry pi to host a bot. 

**Next week?**

I need to learn React more for SWE. I also need to do more programming problems for CS104c and upcoming interviews.

**What's in my way?**

At the moment I am writing this, I have slept 3 hours in the past 40. My sleep schedule got really bad randomly.
	
**What's my experience of the class?**

**Pick-of-the-week**

repl.it is a useful site
