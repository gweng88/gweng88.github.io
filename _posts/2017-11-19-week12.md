**My past week**

I did nothing too productive this week. I caught up on a lot of video games I wanted to play.
I finished up my last cs105 C++ assignment.
My experience of that class is that I now know there is a lot of C++ to learn.

**What's in my way?**


**Next week?**


**What's my experience of the class?**

The ethics talk was really good. Refactoring is pretty interesting.

**Pick-of-the-week**
