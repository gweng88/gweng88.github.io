**And just like that, it's sunday once again...**

**My past week**

Looking back, I can't think of what I did last week. It's all just a blur of going to class, homework, and studying. It was just one of those uneventfully productive weeks. 

Rise and shine, rinse and repeat.

**What's in my way?**

Nothing much. Just keep working and try not to procrastinate too hard. 

**Next week?**

This week I have a very important interview, so hopefully that doesn't crash and burn. Also, IDB is due on thursday, and I suspect we might be cutting it close once again on this one. I also need to figure out if I'm going to HackTX or not. 

**What's my experience of the class?**

I like how downing teaches SQL by first introducing the base relational algebra functions that are used in SQL. It helps give some understanding to the motivation behind SQL. I wish Downing would talk about web development though, perhaps giving a bit of history and some understanding of the landscape. I feel like a lot of people understand HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, but it feels like modern web development is worlds away from that. Maybe a lecture of how we got from that to where we are now would be interesting.

**Pick-of-the-week**

[JSRobot](https://lab.reaal.me/jsrobot/)

This is a cool little project I stumbled upon. It's a game where you control a robot with javascript. The source code is [here](https://github.com/reaalkhalil/JSRobot)
