**My past week**

I got an internship offer this week! This was my first time applying for stuff. Beginning with career fair, all the companies I thought I had a good chance with didn't want me, and a lot of companies I ignored came for me. 

**Next week?**

This week I'm looking forward to going to HackTX. I'm going to spend it teach my friend who's never coded before some Python.

**What's in my way?**


**What's my experience of the class?**


**Pick-of-the-week**
