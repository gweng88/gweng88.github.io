**My past week**

The first step in IDB was due this week. I worked on the static pages and helped write a portion of the technical report. I also had my first mid term of the semester. I had my first ever interview this week as well. It went better than expected but I haven't heard back.

**Next week?**

Next week I hope to learn all about react. I also have two more interviews coming but I don't think I'll prepare for them. 

**What's in my way?**

Recently my sleep schedule has been wild and unpredictable. 
	
**What's my experience of the class?**


**Pick-of-the-week**

The EERC is now open to the public. It's really nice, I like it more than the GDC. Exploring the building was a pretty fun diversion and I recommend other people try.
